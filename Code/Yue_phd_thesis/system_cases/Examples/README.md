# Examples Folder

This folder contains Excel files which save the data of example power systems. These files can be directly used by toolbox, as shown in "UserMain.m".

Please note that the Excel files in this folder are in the format of ".xlsx". By contrast, the "UserData.xlsm" in the root path is in the format of ".xlsm". ".xlsm" is a macro-enabled spreadsheet that can be coded by Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) language by developers. By adjusting the values of "apparatus number" and "apparatus type" in the "Apparatus Sheet" in "UserData.xlsm", it can automatically generate default apparautus parameters with a clearer table header. This advanced function has not yet been added in examples in this folder but will be added soon. The ".xlsx" files can still be used by the toolbox anyway.
