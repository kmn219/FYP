%% Step 3: Modal analysis: participation and eigenvalue sensitivity
% Step 3.1: run 'ModalInitialise.m'. 
% Each time you run this code, it will generate an excel file in 
% 'Simplus-Grid-Tool\Examples\ParticipationAnalysis\', from which you
% will need to select the interesting modes, apparatus, d-q axes...
% If you are using a different matlab version (not 2018b) as me, then run it and select
% manually. After the first time, if the system remains unchanged, don't run it
% otherwise you will loose your selections.

% Step 3.2: run the analysis codes. Figures will pop out.
